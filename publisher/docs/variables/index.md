# Setting Key Variables

In this section, you will set some key variables to tailor the app to your requirements:

* Change the `applicationId` from the default `com.videodac.hls`
* Change the "in-app text" used to guide the user
* Change the parameters used by the app to make payments and request content

You should now have the app imported, and see this screen:

## Change `applicationId`

The default `applicationId` is `com.videodac.hls`. You must change this to something unique to you, otherwise this app with collide with other apps on your device, or in Google Play Store.

To change this text, open `app/res/value/strings.xml`:

* App name (to e.g. "Acme")
* Pay-to address
* Network, from rinkeby, goerli, ropsten, kovan, mainnet, or a    custom RPC URL
* price-per-minute in chosen network's native ETH
* `STREAM_URL` for the video content

You have imported the App and you are at the following screen where these variables can be set (`app/res/values/strings.xml`): 

![import7](../Import/Import7.png)

For example, you may wish to configure the following values in `strings.xml`:

* App name can be set in the "app_name" field.
* Pay-to address can be set in the "wallet_address" field.
* You must set the "infura_url" to choose a network, or this is where you would enter a custom RPC URL.

    * To get an infura_rul proceed to https://infura.io and create an account.
    * Create a new project.
    * You can name the project, and then under keys select the endpoint to be the Ethereum network you wish to use.
    * Copy the link that is generated and paste it in the "infura_url" field of the configuration.

## Change `Utils.kt`

* Open `app/java/com.videodac.hls/helpers/Utils.kt`

* To set the streaming fee, recipient address and STREAM_URL, modify lines 21, 22 and 25 in `Utils.kt` and set the variables `streamingFeeInEth`, `recipientAddress` and `STREAM_URL`
    * There is a test livestream running at http://52.29.226.43:8935/stream/hello_world.m3u8 if you need a resource
    * To find out more about how to create your own STREAM_URL, see [Infinite Digital Stage from videoDAC](https://github.com/videoDAC/infinite-digital-stage).
