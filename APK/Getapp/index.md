# Fetch the App Template: Acme Pay-As-You-Go Livestream Player App

This part of the instructions will vary from situation to situation.

For the purpose of this tutorial, the code that will be used to generate the "Acme" APK is going to be cloned from a Github repository.

## Acme Pay-As-You-Go Livestream Player App

1.  Open a terminal window and move to your root directory: 

    ```
    $ cd ~
    ```

2.  Create a new folder for cloning the repository: 

    ```
    $ mkdir acme
    ```

3.  Move into the gorli directory you just created: 

    ```
    $ cd acme
    ```

4.  Clone the videoDAC `android` repository:
